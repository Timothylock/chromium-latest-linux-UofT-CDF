# Chromium Latest Linux For CDF (UofT)
Scripts to download and run the latest Linux build of Chromium.

It has been modified to work after CDF disabled some features that prevent Chromium from running in sanbox mode. 
NOTE: Since it is running without sandbox, a bad tab can bring down the entire program as well as cause security issues for other tabs. 

## Instructions
1. Download this repo
2. run the update and run script
3. Bonus - Drag the run.sh file to the quicklaunch icons in your taskbar to easily launch chrome from the desktop
