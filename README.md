# chromium-latest-linux
Scripts to download and run the latest Linux build of Chromium.

It has been modified to work after CDF disabled some features that prevent Chromium from running in sanbox mode. 
NOTE: Since it is running without sandbox, a bad tab can bring down the entire program as well as cause security issues for other tabs.
